May smiles bequeath thine,

Told us, Mother Earth divine.

Just then jealously grew on Zeus,

Envious, he set his lightning loose,

Down the middle, them be sliced.

For the bolt, his one word sufficed.

One soul, split in two shells,

To find itself on land it dwells.

Destined in an endless scout.

Frowns became the smiles in drought.

Sipping wine in the sky smirked Zeus.

When the two parts he let loose,

Fought itself that poor soul,

For equality amongst halves of a whole.
