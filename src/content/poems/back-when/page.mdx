Back when notebooks weren't just computers in guise,
Back when we looked for stars not in the calendar but in the sky;
Back when our heads were empty but our hearts full,
Back when we wished to grow into a city where skyscrapers filled the sky:
What happened now, that the Internet doesn't leave our eyes?
What happened now that we are reduced to bare signs?
What happened now, that the empty heart's weight is soaring highs?
Now, we dream of living in a vintage town in the mountains, how does time fly?
