Not the one the navy wore,
Similar to the one by the seashore,
Not the one the skies soar,
Maybe like the royal roar!

It ainâ€™t the lofty baby blue.
Similar to the one azure flew.
Not the one of the turquoise stew.
Maybe like the sapphire view!

The attire you ornament, herculean.
Now I think I know.
Is your sweatshirt cerulean?
Beautiful like flakes of snow.
