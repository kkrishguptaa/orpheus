Beloved, in love, am I?
Now, I don’t even deny.
The moment I met you in July.
Back to 505, we just hesitated, “Hi”.
Will I be yours and you be my?
For you, no beer yet I am so high.
Still, you’re so shy.
Actions of yours, ever so loving sly.
Endearing, without try.
In the future, whereby,
We travel from Brunei to Versailles.
Antoinette in your grace, nigh.
The future, thanksgiving, with love and, pie.
