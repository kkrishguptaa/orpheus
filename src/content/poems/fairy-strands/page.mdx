Painting past the world’s blue and bane?

Velvet veins, how do you withstand so much pain?

And—still shine a smile that reminds me of candy cane.

Tell me, don’t your worst days wear a smile too?

<br />

Don’t you define the words refined and kind?

Just how holy is your heart? Isn’t it heavenly art?

Your grace has made our hearts entwined.

Tell me, how do you have such a holy heart?

<br />

How do you hide the cracks in your light?

Yet make it seem like everything’s right?

I remember the warmth you left me, aether,

On the once in a millennia meeting night.

Please stay, holy heart, don’t leave my sight.

We could always shoulder this plight together.
