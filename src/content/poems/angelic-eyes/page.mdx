In the heart of heaven’s ocean,

Lies a majestic mirror of motion.

The neighbourhood’s reflection,

How could you not, in all this grand perfection,

Feel an animate affection?

<br />

In the heart of heaven’s ocean,

peeking inside, is an intoxicating potion.

You call them your eyes.

I call them a flaw in an angel’s disguise.

<br />

In the song of heaven’s ocean,

Lies all of mankind’s emotion.

In those sapphires of yours,

For all of time, I could sink.

I feel like I wouldn’t even blink.
