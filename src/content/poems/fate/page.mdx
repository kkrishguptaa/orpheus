Had fate not meant it, would we have met?

What if I had never joined that call?

Would the conversation still be on a cassette?

If I hadnâ€™t let emotion make me fall,

Would I have found this calm at all?

<br />

One less than the days of the week,

One more than the planets of the outer ring,

Those voices, that vignette.

Was it just another mischief of fate? Or a memory I bejewel a ring.
