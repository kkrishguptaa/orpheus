Hesitant, I had only uttered Hi,

Where has happiness hid?

Are you off the grid?

How is it already good bye?

<br />

The last word was only hours ago,

Still, it feels like scorching centuries.

Breathing my last within those memories.

Hands turn slower, time drips like snow.

<br />

Do I see a rhythmic rejoice?

My gaze draws close. I sighâ€”

The heart just told me a lie.

Life could you stop turning ice?
