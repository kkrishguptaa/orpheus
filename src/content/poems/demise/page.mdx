Winter night, the whole moon in sight

Yet I might be yearning for moonlight

Swathed in a stained sepia overcoat

There is a need for me to suffer blight

<br />

Stab, slap the sabre right into me

Still, I do not yet desire to be free

I plead ye do not slice my throat

Stab me, by the sea, in the knee

<br />

I implore, impale me a hundred

Rend my nails, make way for red,

For, I will use it to write a final note

Ignite it, it can never be read.
