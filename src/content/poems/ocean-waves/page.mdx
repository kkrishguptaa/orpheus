Still, the ocean waves rest.

Cordially, they curl and swirl.

Look at them, where they whirl.

In the dark, their beauty best.

<br />

Daisy, love, is it the dove nest?

Warm, tender, long of love.

Could it be the crown of lady dove?

The twigs ever so finest.

<br />

Maybe the skipped heartbeats they are?

Where ever may their echoes tango,

The strands, canopy of the tree mango,

Ocean waves, near yet afar.
