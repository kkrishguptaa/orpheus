Those shining locks of black,

Are they telling a lie?

You tied them all back,

With a satin ribbon tie.

<br />

They refused to your notion,

Those few fairy strands stood aside.

“We’re wisps of deep devotion!”

Those waves on your cheek replied.

Lovely fairy strands, you’re the bride,

That brings my heart all this commotion.

<br />

Your fingers folded them behind.

No longer in my sight, I sigh—

Those fairy strands never left my mind,

So next time, whisper ‘Hi’, let them fly.
