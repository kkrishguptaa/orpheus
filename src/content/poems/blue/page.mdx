I’ll imagine we fell in love,
The one where doves circle the sky.
Violins hum, warming the air.
Weightless, like the doves, our hearts fly.

I’ll nap under moonlight skies with you.
Their wings, forming love’s cassette,
Surrounding you, or was it the moon?
Kissing through the smoking cigarette.

Looking around in your eyes, I realise.
The ground is strawberry, the sky is blue.
Just then, Why did I open my eyes?
Well at least, next to me, I saw you.
