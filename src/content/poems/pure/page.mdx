Affection, ever so sly,

Meets me every July.

But along comes regret —

Why can’t I live and let?

<br />

The months of the past,

Count mistakes ever so vast.

Dates, the fifth and sixth run repeat.

Decisions stopped feeling concrete.

<br />

Who knew that ideas of May

would cause my soul this dismay?

Little did the May of me know,

Sixth July, would question it so.
