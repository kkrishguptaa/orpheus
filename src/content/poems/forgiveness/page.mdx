With this felony, forgiveness ends.

Once again, I’ve made myself a jest.

I no longer have a way to make amends.

Under life’s weight, utterly oppressed.

<br />

The soul of mine has already wept.

In this monumental malevolent mess,

I lack in ideas of action, of course, except,

May I plead guilty, your highness.
