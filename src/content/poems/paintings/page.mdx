The paintings that capture motion,
Sometimes otherworldly notions,
Within them lie memories of emotion.
To draw them forth, to stir heart’s potions.

The music, which sends you on a ride,
Of the worlds, even heaven’s poet set aside.
To lands where thoughts need not be confined.
Those who perform are truly divine.
