Even if darling I were in hell,

I’d threaten well, satan in his hotel,

Get him to hand me a working cell.

Because my day ends only when to you, I tell.

<br />

To the satan cell, I send fire bright,

Oh! computer, send her this byte,

To her, the packets must arrive.

And, it’s already good nite.

Send this before she dims the light.
