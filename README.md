NextJs Poetry Showcase Website with Notion as CMS

## üëã Introduction

What is the world but a collection of words? Everything we see, feel, and experience is an assumption, a belief, a word. I am a poet who believes in the power of words to shape our reality. Through my poetry, I explore the depths of human emotion, the beauty of nature, and the complexities of life.

To let the world grasp my poems, I build Orpheus, the website where I showcase them. It is designed to be infrastructure-efficient, fast, and easy to use. I use Notion as my CMS, which allows me to write and manage my poems in a familiar environment. The website is built with Next.js, a powerful framework for building web applications.


## üì¶ Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - CMS for managing poems.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Hosting platform.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type-safe JavaScript.

### Next.js

None of the routes generated are static. The home page is rendered on ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) every 24 hours. Each poem page is server-rendered once and kept forever. The expectation is that published poems shall not receive any edits, while I can still write new poems and publish them.

The image optimization provided by Next.js is NOT used. All images are optimised before putting them in the repository. I have used `cwebp` and `svgo` to optimise images.

### Notion

The notion database is expected to have the following properties:

| Property Name | Type     | Description                         |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Name          | Title    | The title of the poem.              |
| Category      | Select   | Filtering for "Poem"                |
| Status        | Select   | Filtering for "Written" (Published) |
| Written       | Date     | The date the poem was written.      |


I use a Notion automation to set the `Written` date to the current date when the `Status` is changed to `Written`. This ensures that the `Written` date is always accurate and up-to-date.

The "Category" property exists solely because I write more than just poems in that one Notion database.

### Vercel

This website is hosted on Vercel. If you want to deploy it yourself, you can use this handy button:

## ‚úåÔ∏è Deployment

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the project:

```ini
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key
NOTION_DATA_SOURCE_ID=your_notion_database_id
```

You can obtain the `NOTION_API_KEY` by creating an integration in Notion and sharing your database with that integration. The `NOTION_DATA_SOURCE_ID` is the ID of your Notion data source, which can be options menu of your database view in Notion.
